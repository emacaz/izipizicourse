# izipizicourse

Version 1.1 for the izipizicourse website.
"izipizicourse" is currently the website for our english course.
If you are reading this text without a translation it
means you have a good english level unless your native language is English.

Right now we are working on what's gonna be a languages platform.
The biggest languages platform in the world...

A platform where you can learn other languages,
from English but mainly from Spanish. Our
main objective is Latin American people.

If you want to know more about this you
can visit izipizicourse.com, or visit our
social media sites such as @emacastillozam or
@izipizicourse, my personal social media and
the social media for our community.

Thank you for reading this and for helping us
make of LATAM a bilingual society. ðŸ˜ƒ
